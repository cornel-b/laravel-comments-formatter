# Laravel Comments Formatter

Based on this [twitter post](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell/status/563929477265121280?lang=en "Taylor Otwell Linked") and this [reddit article](https://www.reddit.com/r/laravel/comments/3bifw5/every_doc_block_comment_is_3_characters_less_than/ "Reddit post") in the Laravel Framework, comments are three lines and each line is three characters less than the previous one.

This repository provides a very simple way of writing comments this way by displaying a preview and letting you know when the size is right.
